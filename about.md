**WHO IS JEFFREY KENNETH LI**

I grew up a stone's throw away from [this](https://www.yelp.com/biz/soaring-teapot-temple-city).

In a bout of wanderlust, I left home for Texas, and I had a great time at school...

Except for that one time it [REALLY flooded](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/article/hurricane-harvey-texas-flooding).

In my spare time, I [wrote](http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2015/10/i-know-how-you-can-find-your-soulmate), connected with my [roots](https://www.facebook.com/rice.taiwanese.association), and went crabbing. [Once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyS6I0ZEr0).

While studying at Rice, I did some [work in prostate cancer research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5650395/) (it's never too early to think about the end).

Then I spent one summer in [Seattle working on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/).

Since graduating, I've been building better [Audiences at Google](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2497941?hl=en).

And that brings us to now.
