**THINGS I DO IN MY SPARE TIME THAT ARE NOT ENTIRELY USELESS**

[**How well do teams draft? A Statistical Approach **](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6nimvs/oc_how_well_do_teams_draft_a_statistical_approach/)

My dream job was to be a professional basketball player. My second dream job was to be an NBA General Manager. I'll settle for... ahem... devising a model for evaluating NBA front office drafting decisions.

[**Boba Shops Analysis**](https://mynameisjeff.substack.com/p/i-found-every-boba-shop-in-the-us)

I got pretty bored one day, and I thought it would be fun to find every single boba shop in the US.

Once I got the data, I figured I had to share it. Which led to the article **_I FOUND EVERY BOBA SHOP IN THE US + THIS IS THE STATE OF BOBA IN 2021_** which has > 25k views and a few mentions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmynameisjeff.substack.com%2Fp%2Fi-found-every-boba-shop-in-the-us&src=typed_query&f=live). Evidently I am unable to write succinct headlines.

[**Stop AAPI Hate**](https://stopaapihate.org/).

I wouldn't describe myself as an activist, but I do believe in actively and passively making the world a more accepting place. I was particularly troubled by the rise in Asian American hate crimes during the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to me volunteering to help understand incidences of hate crimes reported to Stop AAPI Hate.
